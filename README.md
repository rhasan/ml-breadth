# Machine Learning Breadth

This repository contains review materials related to Machine Learning. Consider this as my glossary for Machine Learning.
So it contains explanations of fundamental Machine Learning concepts and example code whenever necessary.

The contents are mostly from Andrew Ng's courses that I did over the years. 

The nicely formatted documents with search and navigation functinalities are available here: https://ml-breadth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The Table of Contents is a work-in-progress and should improve over time.

This project is inspired by the popular Machine Learning Glossary: https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
